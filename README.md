# MLSpecialization

Note that due to the explicit request in the Code of Honor, not to post solutions in GitHub, I will not (as of now)
post the actual solutions - but will post either related/adapted stuff, or solutions for the ungraded and optional parts.

The graded exercises themselves are quite easy, so it shouldn't be a problem - and you can use the forums/discussion
boards to ask for help.
