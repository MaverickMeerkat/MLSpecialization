Coursera Machine Learning Specialization (Andrew Ng) course exercises

https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning

Note that due to the explicit request in the Code of Honor not to post solutions on GitHub, I will not (as of now)
post the solutions for the graded exercises - but will post rather related/adapted stuff, or solutions for the ungraded
optional parts.

The graded exercises themselves are quite easy, so it shouldn't be much of a problem - and you can use the forums or
discussion boards to ask for help.

## Course 1 - Neural Networks and Deep Learning

## Course 2 - Improving Deep Neural Networks
###  Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization

## Course 3 - Structuring Machine Learning Projects

## Course 4 - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN's)

## Course 5 - Sequence Models (RNN's)
